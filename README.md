# HMP-Blog
This is my personal blog website. A blog website will be dynamically generated website. Any changes to articles shall be made with a web browser.

Database technology is going to be PostreSql. This will be hosted on Google Cloud Service for a free plan.
The website itself is going to hosted on some random hosting service like Herokuu or maybe Hostinger.
