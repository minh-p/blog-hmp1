# HMP-Blog
This is my personal blog website. A blog website will be dynamically generated website. Any changes to articles shall be made with a web browser.

Database technology is going to be PostreSql. This will be hosted on Google Cloud Service for a free plan.
The website itself is going to hosted on some random hosting service like Herokuu or maybe Hostinger.
Backend technology will be Next JS.

All of these technologies would be needed to be learned.
